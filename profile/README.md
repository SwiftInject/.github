# Swift Project
https://swiftproject.top/

Swift is the name of a line of projects we, [@lucaforever](https://github.com/LucaForever), [@nullifiedpntr](https://github.com/nullifiedpntr) and [@Fainton](https://github.com/Fainton) are currently developing.

Projects may be made **public** in the future, depending on the decisions we may take.

Projects made **private** are still a work in project, or contain vital files for different automated processes that aren't meant for public use.
